# Week 8- MySQL JDBC conecpts

## 📅 Day 1 – MySQL Fundamentals
**(Date: 06-02-2026 )**
**(Focus: Database Basics, Transactions & Core SQL Concepts)**

- > Studied the fundamentals of MySQL to understand how relational databases store and manage data.

- > Learned core concepts such as databases, tables, rows, columns, and basic SQL commands (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).

- > Explored constraints including PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and their role in maintaining data integrity.

- > Understood transactions and their importance in ensuring reliable database operations.

- > Learned ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for safe and consistent transaction handling.

- > Practiced transaction control commands like START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

- > Covered additional important concepts such as indexes, normalization basics, and relationships between tables.

- > Focused on writing efficient, consistent, and reliable SQL queries following database best practices.

## 📅 Day 2 – JDBC & MySQL Integration

Date: 10-02-2026

Connected Java application to MySQL using JDBC and implemented complete CRUD operations.

Established database connection using DriverManager and Connection, and executed SQL queries with PreparedStatement to ensure security and prevent SQL injection.

Performed:

INSERT – Add records

SELECT – Fetch records

UPDATE – Modify records

DELETE – Remove records

Also handled exceptions properly and followed clean coding practices for reliable database operations.

## 📅 Day 3 – Database & JDBC: Scenario-Based Practice
(Date: 12-02-2026 ) (Focus: Real-World Hospital Management System Using SQL & JDBC)

Worked on a comprehensive Hospital Management System covering patient, doctor, appointment, visit, billing, and administration workflows.

Applied CRUD operations using SQL to manage patients, doctors, specialties, appointments, and medical records.

Used JOIN queries, subqueries, and aggregate functions to retrieve visit history, doctor availability, billing summaries, and revenue reports.

Implemented transactions (COMMIT/ROLLBACK) to ensure data consistency during booking, rescheduling, visit recording, and payments.

Practiced PreparedStatements for SQL injection prevention, batch operations for bulk inserts, and indexes for performance optimization.

Explored advanced database concepts like foreign keys, triggers for audit logging, metadata usage, and connection pooling.
